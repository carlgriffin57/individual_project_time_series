## Analysis of Global Mean Surface Levels (GMSL) from 1880 - 2013 (monthly)

### PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
Analysis of Global Mean Surface Levels (GMSL) from 1880 - 2013 (monthly)

### GOALS
To be able to make predictions of future GMSL

### DATA DICTIONARY
| Attribute | Definition                                      | Data type |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| GMSL      | Global Mean Sea Level in mm converted to inches | Float64   |


### PROJECT PLANNIG
Data is acquired through a .zip file that was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/somesh24/sea-level-change

Data was clean from the source.  No nulls, missing data, etc.

Explore the data through visualizations.

Train models.

Evaluate models on train and validate datasets.

Choose the model that performs the best.

Evaluate the best model (only one) on the test dataset

### AUDIENCE - Fellow Data Science students

### INSTRUCTIONS FOR RECREATING PROJECT
 Read this README.md
 
 Download the modeling.py and final_notebook_time_series.ipynb into your working directory
 
 Run the final_notebook_time_series.ipynb notebook
 
### DELIVER:
A Jupyter Notebook Report showing process and analysis with goal of finding best model for prediction.

A README.md file containing project description with goals, a data dictionary, project planning (lay out your process through the data science pipeline), instructions or an explanation of how someone else can recreate your project and findings (What would someone need to be able to recreate your project on their own?), and key findings and takeaways from your project.

Individual modules, .py files, that hold your functions to model your data.
